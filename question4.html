                Does it matter to use relative size(%,em,rem) one styling the size of an element so that the element is responsive ? why ? [write your argument]
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    When working on a responsive project it’s more flexible to use relative units 
                    like em for sizing text and spacing in and around elements rather than pixels. 
                    This is because this unit is relative to the font size of its parent element, 
                    allowing an element’s size, spacing and text content to grow proportionally as 
                    the font-size of parent elements change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    em also lends itself to the relative unit rem (‘root em’) for the creation of responsive text. 
                    This is because rem is based on the root element html (and not on the respective element like the 
                    em unit). The effect of this is that the font size adjusts in direct relation to the complete root 
                    element content, which is particularly advantageous when using em for a complex nesting of elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using em and rem units gives us flexibility in our designs, and the ability to scale elements up 
                    and down, instead of being stuck with fixed sizes. We can use this flexibility to make our designs 
                    easier to adjust during development, more responsive, and to allow browser users to control the 
                    overall scale of sites for maximum readability.
